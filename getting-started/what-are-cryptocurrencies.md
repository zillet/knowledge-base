# What are Cryptocurrencies?
Cryptocurrencies are a new form of digital currencies which are built on top of a new technology called blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are secure (through latest encryption techniques), fast and fully traceable.

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.

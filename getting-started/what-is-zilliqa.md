# What is Zilliqa?

**Zilliqa is the first public blockchain designed to implement sharding, allowing for linear scaling as the blockchain grows in size.**

So far, scalability has been a prominent issue for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. Transactions fees and time rise owing to network limitations. 

Zilliqa changes the way a blockchain reaches consensus. It can process tens or hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, depending on the number of nodes on the network. Theoretically, thereâ€™s no limit to this number.

Zilliqa also promises to support smart contracts- a major technical challenge on a sharded network.

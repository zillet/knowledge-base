# What is Scilla?
Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language- in short Scilla, is an intermediate-level smart contract language being developed for Zilliqa. It has been designed as a principled language keeping smart contract safety in perspective.

Scilla eliminates certain unknown vulnerabilities directly at the language-level, hence making applications less prone to attacks. Its principles structure further enforces security and reduces vulnerabilities. Scilla is inherently amenable to formal verification.

The language is being developed hand-in-hand with the formalization of its semantics and its embedding into the Coq proof assistant â€” a state-of-the-art tool for mechanized proofs about properties of programs.

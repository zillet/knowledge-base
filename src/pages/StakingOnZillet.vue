        What are the benefits of staking?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When you stake your ZILs, your receive ZIL as a reward.
        This interest, reward, or inflation heavily incentivizes staking and is why you should delegate over long periods.

        Who should you delegate your ZILs to?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is no best choice. Every SSN has its characteristics. However, most people want to pick the safest and most
        secure SSN so they donâ€™t lose any rewards. However, it is a general misunderstanding that
        there is a single best SSN to delegate safely. The best SSN to safely delegate is all of them.
        If you spread your ZILs across all SSNs, the risk is the lowest. 
        You can check the table for the commission rate and details about SSN below.

        Why should I delegate to Zillet?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Zillet is an open-source project with no revenue source currently, and it's one of the main pieces of the Zilliqa ecosystem.
        Zillet also has a competitive commission rate, and all the commission earned will be used for the development of the wallet.
        So it'll help us if you delegate your ZILs to Zillet while maintaining your security.

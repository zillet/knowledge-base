# What is a Mnemonic Phrase?

Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘recovery phrases’ or ‘seed words’, are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific wallet addresses. These are typically used for recovery and allow direct access into one’s wallet, so they should be treated carefully.

Mnemonic phrases can sometimes be paired with a password as well for added encryption and security. When wallets offer this service, the password is used as an extra added word to the end of the phrase. For example, 12-word phrases become 13 words, and 24-word phrases become 25 words.

In terms of privacy, mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key. Anyone can permanently access your wallet with your phrase. Furthermore, these phrases cannot be changed so keeping them safe is crucial.


**Tips for keeping your mnemonic phrase safe and private:** 
- Keep these lists in easy-to-remember, separate locations.
- Don’t keep the words on a computer, write them down on physical paper.
- Make sure you spelled all the words correctly. Always double-check your work.
- Make sure you write the words in the correct order– the phrase will not work if the sequence is incorrect.
- Avoid hand-typing your phrase into computers that are connected to the internet.

# How to Avoid Phishing and Scams?

**Here is a list of tips and tricks to avoid common phishing/scam techniques: **

1. Secure your access method: This is the number one defense against phishing.

2. Install EAL, PhishFort, or Cryptonite or other trusted Chrome Extensions that warn you when visiting malicious sites.

3. Never click on a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company: Try searching for the service on Google and find the information there. Make sure you are not looking at an ad.

4. **Do not** give your private key, mnemonic phrase, or keystore file to anyone! You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.

5. Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents over and under the letters. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting. Bookmark all the sites you frequent most.

6. Always Google search any token sale or ICO in which you are interested. If it’s a scam, others in the community will likely be posting about it on Twitter, Reddit, etc.

7. There are many fake bots and accounts out there, so search smart and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.

8. Double and triple-check everything: Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet. Transactions cannot be reversed or refunded, so this is very important!
